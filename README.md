For my teacher or classmates in need of a guide to setup the app locally :D


Steps to run: 

Run:
Composer Install
Npm install  (Not at all necessary)
Php artisan migrate
Php artisan db:seed (Really important, do not forget to run)

Copy env example content to a newly created .env file (Way too important, app wont work otherwise)

Run:
Php artisan key:generate (Just as necessary as creating the .env)
